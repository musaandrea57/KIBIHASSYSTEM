# KIBIHAS Official Academic Structure Verification Checklist

## 1. Programme Definitions (Authoritative)
- [x] **Diploma in Diagnostic Radiography (CRT)**
  - Status: Active
  - NTA Levels: 4 (only)
  - Credits: 12-30 per semester
  - Modules: 6 specific Level 4 modules seeded.
- [x] **Diploma in Nursing and Midwifery (NMT)**
  - Status: Active
  - NTA Levels: 4, 5, 6

  - Credits: 12-30 per semester
  - Modules: 19 modules seeded across all levels.
- [x] **Legacy Programs**
  - All non-authoritative programs (DNM, DCD, DDR) set to `Inactive`.

## 2. Technical Implementation
- [x] **Database Schema**
  - `programs` table: Includes code, limits, active status.
  - `modules` table: Includes `nta_level`, `semester_number` (fixed via migration).
  - `module_offerings` table: Created to link Module <-> Year/Semester.
  - `programme_level_rules` table: Seeded with credit limits.
- [x] **Seeding**
  - `AcademicStructureSeeder`: Implemented as the single source of truth.
  - Idempotent execution verified (uses `updateOrCreate`).
  - Transactional safety enabled.

## 3. Validation Rules
- [x] **Student Registration**
  - Logic: Filters offerings by `Student Program` + `Student Level`.
  - Source: `RegistrationController` uses strict filtering on `ModuleOffering`.
  - Constraint: Students cannot see modules outside their programme/level.
- [x] **Teacher Assignment**
  - Logic: Assignment UI filters for `Active` programs/offerings only.
  - Constraint: Only valid modules (generated by authoritative seeder) are available for assignment.
- [x] **Credit Limits**
  - Enforced via `ProgrammeLevelRule` and `Program` defaults (12-30 credits).

## 4. Output & Reporting
- [x] **Transcripts/Results**
  - Module Codes: Exact codes (e.g., `CRT 04101`) stored in DB.
  - Module Titles: Exact titles stored in DB.
  - No dummy data allowed/present in active set.

## 5. Verification
- Verified via `verify_curriculum.php` script.
- Confirmed correct module counts:
  - CRT: 6
  - NMT: 19
  - CDT: 19
- Confirmed active offerings for 2025/2026 Semester 1: 61 total.
